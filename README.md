# Bias-reduction
📖 Project Overview
A deep learning-based system designed to detect and classify medical images as real or AI-generated/synthetic, with built-in bias reduction techniques to ensure  accurate model performance across diverse medical imaging datasets.


🎯 Purpose
Detect AI-generated medical images that may introduce bias in diagnostic models

Reduce dataset bias using advanced data augmentation and synthetic data generation

Ensure model fairness in medical AI applications

Provide transparency in identifying synthetic medical imagery
